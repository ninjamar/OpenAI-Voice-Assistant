# Known bugs
The app will crash if the mic being used is disconnected from the computer. If it doesn't respond to clicking Exit, use kill.bat to kill the program if using the prebuilt release (providing that it wasn't renamed to something else other than openai_voice.exe), else kill Python or the prebuilt app from the task manager.

# Workaround
Before disconnecting your mic, make sure the mic is not in use by the program. This can be done by unchecking 'Listen for "Computer"' and making sure the assistant is idle.

# Warnings
Do not run the script in a non-Windows OS or without all the dependencies, or the script will crash immediately.

Do not run the prebuilt EXE in WINE as it will crash immediately.
